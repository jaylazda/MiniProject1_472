(a) The classes are pretty well balanced, there are 2 classes (business and sport) with about 100-150 more documents
compared to the other 3 classes. The other 3 are all around the same amount (386, 417, 401). Since there are a lot of documents
in the test set (445 if using 20% of data), we would favor a higher precision over a higher recall. We want to be confident that the documents 
of our class of interest actually belong to that class. 
 
(b) The results from the first two attempts are the exact same, with a macro avg precision of 0.95 and a macro avg recall of 0.94.
This is likely because we did not change anything in the model, we just ran it again therefore it produced the same results. The third
attempt with smoothing set to 0.0001 resulted in a macro avg precision and macro avg recall of 0.98, better in both categories than the
first two models. The last model (smoothing = 0.9) resulted in a macro avg precision of 0.96 and macro avg recall of 0.95, so better than the first two
but not as accurate as the 3rd model. This means the smoothing value of 0.0001 is the best out of these trials. The addition of a smoothing parameter
eliminates any strange scenarios when there are zeros present for certain word frequencies which explains the difference between the first two models
and the last two.
