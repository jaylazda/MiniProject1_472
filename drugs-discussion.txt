Does the same model give you the same performance every time?

It depends on the model. For example, both the Base Decision Tree and the Top Decision Tree models result in perfect
scores each time. Their average accuracy, macro and weighted F1 scores are all 1.0 with 0 standard deviation. 
This means that the drug data is easily classified by decision trees. The Gaussian Naive Bayes model and the Perceptron model
also result in the same results every time. They both have extremely small values (1e-16 and 5e-17) for one of the F1 averages,
but this is likely due to a rounding error with the small digits of the other scores. 

The only 2 models that don't result in the same performance every time are the Base Multi-Layered Perceptron and the Top 
Multi-Layered Perceptron models. This is likely because for each time the models are trained, they reach the maximum number of 
iterations (200) but haven't converged yet. (I suppressed this warning in my program because it prints a lot) Since the models 
haven't converged, they will have different weights for each perceptron in the neural network resulting in different performance.
